- 👋 Hi, I’m @johngalt603 - I currently reside in the greater Charlotte area, but was born and grew up in New England (NH/MA/ME).
- 👀 I’m interested in all things PC gaming & hardware hacking/homelab, along with my day job as an IT Professional, focused on IT consulting.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking a well deserved mental health break and brushing up on some long overdue professional certifications (CompTIA, Microsoft, Fortinet, VMware, and Nutanix).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any consulting engagements or fun side projects with like-minded folks.
